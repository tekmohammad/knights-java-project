	// Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires 
	// (Getting), all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. ...
	// The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new 
	// classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from
	// an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class.
	
	// We have four types of Inheritance
	
	// 1. Single Inheritance: In Single Inheritance one class 
	//     extends another class (one class only).
	
	// 2. Multilevel Inheritance: In Multilevel Inheritance, one class can 
	// 	  inherit from a derived class. Hence, the derived class becomes 
	//    the base class for the new class
