	// OOP -> Stands for Object Oriented Programming.
	
// 		Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is
	//	based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data 
	//  and code. Data is in the form of fields (also known as attributes
	//  or properties), and code is in the form of methods 
	// (functions or procedures).
	
	// Benifits:
	// 1. Code is going to be clean and more readable.
	
	// OOP have four pillars: 

	// 1. Encapsulation: Bundles the data and the methodd that will operate
	// in those data into a single unit. where unit is a class
	// and the data are the fields and methods (functions).
	
	// -> We are going to hide the implenetation of the program from the user
	// and we are just going to give the functionality access to user.
	
	// 2. Inheritance
	// 3. Polymorphism
	// 4. Abstraction
