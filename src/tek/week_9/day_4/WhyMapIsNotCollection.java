public class WhyMapIsNotCollection {
	/*
	 * The term "Java Collections Framework" (JCF) often refers to the 
	 * framework in the java.util package, which includes core collection 
	 * interfaces like List, Set, and Queue. 
	 * However, Map is a bit of an outlier. While it is part of the same 
	 * framework and is closely related, it doesn't technically extend the
	 * Collection interface, whereas List, Set, and Queue do.
	 */

//	Key differences:

	/*
	 * Value Storage: The Collection interface handles and stores individual
	 * elements, while the Map interface handles key-value pairs.
	 * 
	 * Unique Elements: For collections like Set, there's a guarantee of unique
	 * elements. In contrast, a Map guarantees unique keys, but not necessarily
	 * unique values.
	 * 
	 * Methods: The methods you find in the Collection interface (like add(),
	 * remove(), and contains()) are not present in the Map interface. Instead, Map
	 * has its own set of methods like put(), get(), and containsKey().
