	 * TreeMap is an implementation of the NavigableMap interface in Java, 
	 * which in turn extends the SortedMap interface. 
	 * It stores its elements in key-value pairs similar 
	 * to other maps. However, the primary distinction is that a
	 * TreeMap is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys 
	 * or by a comparator provided at map creation time.

	/*
	 * Sorted: The map is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys 
	 * or bya comparator provided during its creation. 
	 * This ensures ordered key-value pairs when iterating.
	 * 
	 * Key Uniqueness: Like other map implementations, each key in a TreeMap must be
	 * unique.
	 * 
	 * Doesn't Allow Null: Unlike HashMap and LinkedHashMap,
	 * TreeMap doesn't allow null keys. However, it does allow multiple null values. If you attempt to add
	 * a null key, it will throw a NullPointerException.
