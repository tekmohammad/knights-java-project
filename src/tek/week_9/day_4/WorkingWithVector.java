	 * Vector is a legacy class in Java that's part of the Java Collections
	 * Framework (JCF). It's similar to ArrayList in many ways, as both are
	 * implementations of the List interface and provide dynamically resizable
	 * arrays. However, there are some important differences.
	 */
	
	/*
	 * Synchronized: One of the most significant distinctions is that Vector methods
	 * are synchronized. This means that they are thread-safe, and multiple threads
	 * can safely access a Vector without external synchronization. In contrast,
	 * ArrayList methods are not synchronized.
	 * 
	 * Capacity Increment: If a Vector instance's size exceeds its capacity, 
	 * it increases its array size by the capacityIncrement 
	 * (an instance variable). 
	 * If capacityIncrement is not set (i.e., zero), 
	 * the array's size is doubled.
	 * ArrayList, on the other hand, grows by 50% of its current 
	 * size when element exceed its capacity.
	 * 
	 * Performance: Because Vector is synchronized, it can be slower than ArrayList
	 * when synchronization is not needed.
