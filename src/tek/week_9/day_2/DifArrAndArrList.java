	 * 	  size without creating a new array and copying elements.
	   
	    ArrayList: Is dynamic. It can grow or shrink as needed. 
	    Underlying, it uses an array, but it manages resizing automatically.   
*/
	
/*	Type:
	    Array: Can store both primitives (like int, char, boolean) and 
	    objects (like String, Integer, custom objects).
	    
	    ArrayList: Stores only objects. Even if you want to store primitive 
	    data types, they will be autoboxed into wrapper classes 
	    (like int becomes Integer).

/*
 * Performance:
 * 
 * Array: Generally faster and requires less memory because there's no overhead
 * of additional methods and properties associated with ArrayList.
 *  
 * ArrayList: Might introduce some overhead because of its dynamic 
 * nature and the additional methods it offers.
 */
	
/*
 * Memory:
 * 
 * Array: Uses less memory as it only stores values.
 * 
 *  ArrayList: Uses more memory than an array because, 
 *  for each element, it has an additional overhead 
 *  of storing the data about the size and other properties.
