	/*
	 * LinkedList is a part of Java's collection framework (java.util package) 
	 * and represents a doubly-linked list. In a linked list, 
	 * each element (known as a node) contains two pieces of information: 
	 * the data and a reference to the next (and in the case of a doubly-linked list, the previous) node in the
	 * sequence.
	 */
	
	// Key features of the linked list:
	
	/* 1.
	 * Node-Based Structure: Unlike arrays or ArrayList, which use a 
	 * contiguous block of memory, a LinkedList is composed of individual
	 * nodes. 
	 * Each node contains the data and references to the next 
	 * and previous nodes.
	 * 
	 * 2. 
	 * Doubly-Linked: Java's LinkedList is a doubly-linked list,
	 * which means that each node has a reference to both its next 
	 * node and its previous node. This allows for bidirectional
	 *  traversal.
	 *  
	 *  3.
	 *  Dynamic Size: LinkedList can grow or shrink in size
	 *  dynamically as elements are added or removed.
