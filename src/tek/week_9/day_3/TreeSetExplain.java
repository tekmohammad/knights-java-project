	/*
	 * TreeSet is another Java class that implements the Set interface. 
	 * Unlike HashSet and LinkedHashSet,which are backed by hash tables,
	 *  TreeSet is backed  by a red-black tree 
	 *  (a type of self-balancing binary search tree).
	 *   As a result, the elements in a TreeSet are 
	 *   always in a sorted order.
	 */
	
	// Key features
	
	/*
	 * Sorted: Elements in a TreeSet are sorted. This can be based on their natural
	 * ordering or using a custom comparator.
	 * 
	 * No Duplicate Values: Like other Set implementations, TreeSet doesn't allow
	 * duplicate values.
	 * 
	 * Null Values: TreeSet does not allow null values. Adding null will throw a
	 * NullPointerException.
