	// HashMap:
	/*
	 * HashMap is one of the most widely used implementations of 
	 * the Map interface in Java. It stores data in 
	 * key-value pairs, and it allows you to retrieve a value based on
	 * its associated key. HashMap works by using a hashing technique, 
	 * where the keys are processed by a hash function to produce an
	 * index in an array, where the corresponding value will be stored.
	 */
	// Key features of the HashMap
	/*
	 * Unordered: The elements (key-value pairs) in a HashMap are not ordered.
	 * Neither by their key nor by their value.
	 * 
	 * Key Uniqueness: Each key in the HashMap must be unique. 
	 * If you try to insert a key-value pair with a key that's already in the map, 
	 * the old value for that key will be replaced.
	 * 
	 * Allows Null: HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values.
