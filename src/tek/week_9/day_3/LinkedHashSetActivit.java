	 * LinkedHashMap is a subclass of HashMap and also

	 * It maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries, 
	 * which ensures the order of the key-value pairs. 
	 * This order can either be the order in which keys were 
	 * inserted into the map (insertion order) or the order in which keys
	 * were last accessed, from least-recently accessed to most-recently
	 * (access order).

	/*
	 * Ordered: Unlike HashMap, which is unordered, LinkedHashMap maintains the
	 * order of key-value pairs. By default, it's the order in which they were
	 * inserted into the map (insertion order). However, if you use the 
	 * constructor with the boolean argument set to true,
	 *  it will be in access order.
	 * 
	 * Key Uniqueness: Just like HashMap, each key in the LinkedHashMap must be
	 * unique.
	 * 
	 * Allows Null: LinkedHashMap allows one null key and multiple null values.
