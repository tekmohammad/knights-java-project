public class ArrayList {
	// In Java, ArrayList is one of the most widely used classes from 
	// the Collections framework. It provides a dynamic array, 
	// which means you can add or remove items from it after it's been created.
	
	/*
	 * 1.Dynamic Sizing: Unlike a traditional array, an ArrayList automatically
	 * resizes itself when you add or remove elements. 
	 * 2.Implements List Interface: ArrayList implements the List interface, 
	 * so it's ordered and elements can be accessed by their index position. 
	 * 3.Allows Duplicates: You can store duplicate values in an ArrayList.
	 * 4.Allows null: ArrayList can have null values. 
	 * 5.Initial Capacity: When created, an ArrayList has an initial capacity. 
	 * If the elements exceed this capacity, the array is resized 
	 * (typically it's doubled).
	 * 6.Iterable: ArrayList implements the Iterable interface, so you can iterate
	 * over its elements using enhanced for-loops or iterators.
