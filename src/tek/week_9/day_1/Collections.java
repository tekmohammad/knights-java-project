	 * Defination collections: A collection is essentially an object 
	 * that groups multiple elements into a single unit. 
	 * The Collections framework provides many data structures and 
	 * algorithms to store and manipulate groups of data in memory.

	// Benefits of using the collection:
	
	/*
	 * 1. Performance: Implementations are high-performance data structures.
	 * 2. Flexibility: Since they're based on interfaces, you can use custom
	 *  implementations if needed. 
	 * 3. Reduces Effort: Don't have to reinvent the wheel;
	 * many data structures and algorithms are readily available. Quality: Being
	 * 4. part of the Java Standard Library means they've been tested and 
	 * refined over time.
