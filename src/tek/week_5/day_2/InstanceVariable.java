// Instance Variables 

// Instance variables are those variables which is declared inside of the 
// class but outside of the method, constructor or any block. Instane variables
// are also called class scope variables they are also called Fields.

// Instance variables have some characterstics:

// 1. The will be created when the object of the class is created. 

// 2. Instance variables have default values, for the numbers it is 0
// for the reference it is null and for the boolean is is false. 

// 3. The scope of instance variables are within the class -> and since
// inside of the class we have different methods or no methods at all
// still you can access the Instance variables. 

public class InstanceVariable { // Start of the class Block
	
	static String InsVariable;
	// Static means that compiler can access this variable or value 
	// without creating it's object why? because it belongs to main method.
