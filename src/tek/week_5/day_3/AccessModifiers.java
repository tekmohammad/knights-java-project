	// Access modifiers: they are keywords that will define the accessibility
	// of your Class, fields (variables), Methods (functions), interfaces,
	// or any other members. 
	
	/*
	 * // 1: Public: The public access modifier is accessible everywhere. 
	 * If a class, method, variable, etc is declared as public, it can
	 *  be accessed from any class in any package (it means from your 
	 *  entire project). 
	 *  
	 * // Example: 
	 * 
	 * public class MyClass {
	 * public int myVar = 10; // Accessible everywhere // 
	 *
	 * }
	 */	
	
	/*
	 * 2: Private: The private access modifier is accessible only within 
	 * the same class. So, if something is declared as private, 
	 * it can't be seen outside of its own class.
	 * 
	 * Example:
	 * 
	 * public class MyClass { // Start of the class
	 *  private int myVar = 10; // Only accessible within MyClass 
	 *  } // End of the class 
	 */
	
	/*
	 * 3: Protected: The protected access modifier is accessible within 
	 * package and outside the package but through inheritance only. 
	 * So, if something is declared as protected, it can be accessed 
	 * from within the same class, from any class within the same 
	 * package, and from subclasses in any package.
	 * 
	 * Example:
	 * 
	 * public class MyClass {
	 * 
	 *  protected int myVar = 10; // Accessible within
	 * 		MyClass, any class in the same package, and subclasses 
	 * 
	 * }
	 */
	
	/*
	 * 4: Default (Package-private): When no access modifier is specified, 
	 * it's set to default. The default modifier is accessible 
	 * only within package. So, if you have a class, variable, method 
	 * etc without a modifier, it can be accessed from any class
	 *  within the same package.
	 *  
	 * Example:
	 * 
	 * class MyClass { // MyClass has default access modifier 
	 * 
	 * int myVar = 10; // myVar also has default access modifier 
	 * 
	 * }
	 */
