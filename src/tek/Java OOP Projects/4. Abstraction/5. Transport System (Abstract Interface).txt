Objective: Model various modes of transport, focusing on the common operations each mode should support.

Steps:

    1. Create an interface named Transport.
    2. Define methods like start(), stop(), and fuelUp().
    3. Implement this interface in concrete classes such as Car, Bicycle, and Boat.
    4. Each concrete class should provide a unique implementation for the interface methods.
    5. In the main method, simulate a journey using various modes of transport.
