Objective: Understand how to create a basic framework for various payment methods without implementing the specifics.

Steps:

    1. Create an abstract class named PaymentGateway.
    2. Define abstract methods like authorize(), debit(), and credit().
    3. Create concrete classes like CreditCard, DigitalWallet, and BankTransfer extending PaymentGateway.
    4. Implement the abstract methods in each concrete class with their specific logics.
    5. In the main method, instantiate different payment methods and process a payment through each one.
