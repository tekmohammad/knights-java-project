Objective: Understand how abstraction can be used to create a structure for shapes and their operations.

Steps:

    1. Create an abstract class named Shape.
    2. Define abstract methods draw() and area().
    3. Add a concrete method displayInfo() that prints basic info about the shape.
    4. Create subclasses like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle extending Shape.
    5. Implement the abstract methods in each subclass.
    6. In the main method, create a list of Shape objects, populate it with different shapes, and display their information.
