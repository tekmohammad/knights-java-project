Objective: Understand how a class can inherit behaviors from multiple interfaces.

Steps:

    1. Create two interfaces: WiFi with methods connectToWiFi() and disconnectFromWiFi(), and Bluetooth with methods connectToBluetoothDevice() and disconnectFromBluetoothDevice().
    2. Design a class SmartSpeaker that implements both WiFi and Bluetooth.
    3. Implement the methods of both interfaces, enabling the smart speaker to connect via both WiFi and Bluetooth.
    5. In the main method, interact with a SmartSpeaker object, managing its connectivity.
