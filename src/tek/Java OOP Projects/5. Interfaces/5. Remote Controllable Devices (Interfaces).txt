Objective: Apply the principle of separating interface from implementation by defining actions for remote-controllable devices.

Steps:

    1. Create an interface named RemoteControllable.
    2. Define methods like turnOn(), turnOff(), and setVolume(int level).
    3. Develop concrete classes Television, AirConditioner, and Radio implementing the RemoteControllable interface.
    4. Implement the defined methods in each class according to the behavior of each device.
    5. In the main method, simulate the use of a universal remote control to interact with various devices.
