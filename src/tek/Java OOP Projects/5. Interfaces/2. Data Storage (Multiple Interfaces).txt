Objective: Realize how a class can implement multiple interfaces to gain a combination of behaviors.

Steps:

    1. Create two interfaces: Storable with methods storeData() and retrieveData(), and Encryptable with methods encrypt() and decrypt().
    2. Design a class SecureDrive that implements both Storable and Encryptable.
    3. Implement the methods of both interfaces, adding both data storage and encryption capabilities to the class.
    4. In the main method, interact with a SecureDrive object, storing, retrieving, encrypting, and decrypting data.
