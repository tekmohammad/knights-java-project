Objective: Understand how interfaces can be used to enforce a set of behaviors across unrelated classes.

Steps:

    1. Create an interface named MusicalInstrument.
    2. Define methods like play(), tune(), and stop().
    3. Create concrete classes Piano, Guitar, and Violin implementing the MusicalInstrument interface.
    4. Implement the defined methods in each class to provide specific behaviors for each instrument.
    5. In the main method, simulate a musical concert where various instruments are played.
