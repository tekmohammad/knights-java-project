Objective: Explore the use of default methods in interfaces, introduced in Java 8.

Steps:

    1. Create an interface named GameCharacter.
    2. Define methods like attack(), defend(), and a default method run() which prints "Character is running".
    3. Develop concrete classes Warrior, Mage, and Archer implementing the GameCharacter interface.
    4. Implement the attack and defend methods in each class.
    5. In the main method, instantiate various characters and make them attack, defend, and run.
