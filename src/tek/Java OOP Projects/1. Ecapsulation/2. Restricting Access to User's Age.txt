Objective: Understand how to restrict direct modification to a sensitive member variable.

Steps:

    1. Create a class called User.
    2. Define a private member variable age (type int).
    3. Provide a constructor to initialize age.
    4. Implement a public method setAge(int age) that sets the age only if it's within a valid range (e.g., 0-120).
    5. Implement a public method getAge() to return the user's age.
    6. In a main method, create a User object, set its age, and display it.
