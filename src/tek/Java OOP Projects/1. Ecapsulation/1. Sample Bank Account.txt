Objective: Understand the importance of private member variables and public methods.

Steps:

    1. Create a class called BankAccount.
    2. Define two private member variables: balance (type double) and accountNumber (type String).
    3. Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
    4. Implement public methods deposit(double amount), withdraw(double amount), and getBalance() to manipulate and view the balance.
    5. Ensure that withdraw checks if there are enough funds before performing the operation.
    6. In a main method, create a BankAccount object, deposit, and withdraw funds, and display the balance.
