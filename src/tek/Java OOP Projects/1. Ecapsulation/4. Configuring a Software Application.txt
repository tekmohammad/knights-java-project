Objective: Understand the use of encapsulation for creating a configuration module.

Steps:

    1. Create a class called AppConfig.
    2. Define private member variables to store configuration details, like serverIP, port, databaseName, etc.
    3. Implement public setter and getter methods for each of these member variables.
    4. Ensure that specific configuration values, like port, are within valid ranges (e.g., 0-65535) when being set.
    5. In a main method, create an AppConfig object, set its parameters, and display them.
