Objective: Understand inheritance for categorizing objects and their behaviors.

Steps:

    1. Create a base class named ElectronicDevice with properties like brand, powerStatus and methods such as turnOn() and turnOff().
    2. Derive a subclass named Television from ElectronicDevice. Add new properties like volume and a new method changeVolume().
    3. In a main method, instantiate a Television object, manipulate its properties, and observe its behaviors.
