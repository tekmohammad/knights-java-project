Objective: Understand how multiple classes can inherit from a single parent class.

Steps:

    1. Create a base class named Shape with properties like color, area, and methods such as calculateArea().
    2. Derive subclasses like Circle, Square, and Triangle from Shape. Override the calculateArea() method in each derived class to compute areas specific to the shape.
    3. In a main method, create objects for Circle, Square, and Triangle, set their specific properties, and compute their areas.
