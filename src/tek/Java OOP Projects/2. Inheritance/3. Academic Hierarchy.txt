Objective: Understand how classes can be derived from other derived classes, forming a chain of inheritance.

Steps:

    1. Create a base class named Person with properties like name, age.
    2. Derive a subclass named Student from Person. Add properties like studentID and methods such as study().
    3. Derive another subclass named GraduateStudent from Student. Add properties like researchTopic and methods such as conductResearch().
    4. In a main method, create an object of GraduateStudent, set its properties, and call its methods to see multi-level inheritance in action.
