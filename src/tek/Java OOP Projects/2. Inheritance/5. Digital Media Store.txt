Objective: Understand how to structure classes that share a common parent but have distinct characteristics.

Steps:

    1. Create a base class named DigitalMedia with properties like title, price, and methods such as displayInfo().
    2. Derive subclasses like Ebook, AudioTrack, and VideoClip from DigitalMedia. Each subclass should have unique properties. For instance, Ebook might have numPages,      	AudioTrack might have duration, and VideoClip might have resolution.
    3. Override the displayInfo() method in each subclass to display specific information about the media type.
    4. In a main method, instantiate objects for each of the derived classes, populate their properties, and display their information.
