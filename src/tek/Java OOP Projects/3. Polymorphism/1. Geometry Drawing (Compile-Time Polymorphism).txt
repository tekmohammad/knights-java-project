Objective: Understand method overloading as a form of compile-time polymorphism.

Steps:

    1. Create a class named GeometryDrawer.
    2. Implement overloaded methods draw() that take different shapes as arguments, e.g., draw(Circle circle), draw(Square square), and draw(Triangle triangle).
    3. Each method should print out drawing instructions for the provided shape.
    4. In the main method, instantiate different shapes and call the appropriate draw() method.
