Objective: Use overridden methods in subclasses to provide specific implementations.

Steps:

    1. Create an abstract class named MediaPlayer with a method named play().
    2. Derive subclasses like MP3Player, WAVPlayer, and AACPlayer from MediaPlayer.
    3. Override the play() method in each subclass to provide format-specific playing instructions.
    4. In the main method, create an array of MediaPlayer, fill it with different player objects, iterate through it, and call the play() method on each object.
