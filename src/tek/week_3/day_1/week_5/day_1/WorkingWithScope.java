	// What is Scope? 
	// Scope: It refers to the lifecycle and accesscibility of a variable.
	
	// We are telling the compiler to access the variable from where.
	// or we can say that our variable can be accessed from where
	
	//  * -> scopre defines where the variable and be seen and can be accessed.
	//  * -> The Scope can be defined by the block of the code.
	
	// 1.Class Scope (Fields, Members of class or Instance Variable):
	// Are those variables that can be accessed within the class and the methods
	
	// 2. Method Scope (Local scope): The variables can be accessed only 
	// within the method, not outside of the method. But method scope cannot
	// be accessed outside of the method.
	
	// 3. Block Scope: You can access it wihtin the block of your code. 
	// but it cannot be accessed outside of the block.
	
	// 4. Loop Scope: The Loop scope can only be accessed inside of the loop
	// block and cannot be accessed outide of the loop.
