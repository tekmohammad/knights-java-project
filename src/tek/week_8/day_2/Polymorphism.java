	/*
	 * Polymorphism allows us to perform a task in multiple ways. 
	 * Let’s break the word Polymorphism and see it, ‘Poly’ means ‘Many’
	 *  and ‘Morphos’ means ‘Shapes’. Assume we have four students and we 
	 * asked them to draw a shape. All the four may draw different 
	 * shapes like Circle, Triangle, and Rectangle.

	// We have two types of polymorphism
	
	// 1. Method OverLoading (Compile Time)- (Static Binding): 
	// A class having multiple methods with same name but different 
	// parameters is called Method Overloading There are three ways
	// to overload a method.
	/*
	 * * Parameters with different data types
	 * • Parameters with different sequence of a data types
	 * • Different number of parameters
