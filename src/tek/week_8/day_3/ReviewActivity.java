	// 			Practicing Method Overriding.
	// 			***		Activity    ***		

	// You are tasked with modeling different animals and the sounds they make. 
	// At a basic level, every animal can make a sound, but the exact sound 
	// varies depending on the type of animal.
	
	// Instructions:
	/*
	 * 1. Base Class: Create a class named Animal that has a method named 
	 * makeSound()which prints "Animal makes a sound".
	 * 
	 * 2. Derived Classes: Create a class Dog that extends Animal and 
	 * overrides the makeSound() method to print "Dog barks". 
	 * 
	 * 3.Create another class Cat that
	 * extends Animal and overrides the makeSound() method to print 
	 * "Cat meows".
	 * 
	 * 4. Testing: In your main method, create instances of Dog and Cat, and call their
	 * makeSound() methods to observe the overridden behavior.
