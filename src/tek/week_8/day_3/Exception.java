	 * An Exception is a problem that can occur during the normal flow of an
	 * execution. 
	 * 
	 * A method can throw an exception when something fails at 
	 * runtime.
	 * 
	 * If that exception couldn’t be handled, then the execution gets 
	 * terminated before it completes the task. 
	 * 
	 * If we handled the exception, then the normal
	 * flow gets continued. Exceptions are a subclass of java.lang.Exception.
